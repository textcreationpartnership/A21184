            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.6. Heb. 11.13 1. Pet. 2.11</note> it shall be our wisedome as <hi>strangers and pilgrimes to abstaine from fleshly lusts, which fight against the soule:</hi> euen as it is the wisedome of a
<pb facs="tcp:456:3"/>pilgrime or traueller to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine (as much as is possible) from all things, that may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract his minde from the loue and desire of his owne home, or cause him to linger in the way, and triflle out his time, til either his meanes or strength doe faile him, whereby hee should come to the end of his entended iourney.</p>
            <p>For euery pilgrime or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller hath three things especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to looke vnto. The first is the scope and end of his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The second is the direct and ready way that leadeth to it. The third is what things they be, which may either fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:456:3"/>him or hinder him in this way, that accordingly he may embrace the one,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> and shunne the other. And these three are all of them plainely and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully laied out vnto vs in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generall end &amp; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as of al creatures,
<note place="margin">Pro. 16.4.</note> so more specially of the redeemed of Christ, is the glory of God.
<note place="margin">Num. 9.23</note> But there is a more particular end in regard of our selues,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> which we ought euery day &amp; houre, yea (if it were possible) euery minute and moment to set before our eyes, and the same is double.</p>
            <p>The first and principall end
<pb facs="tcp:456:4"/>in regard of our selues,
<note place="margin">Psal. 16.11 &amp;. 17.15.</note> is, a perfect and perpetuall fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods most gratious and glorious presence in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. The second is a sound perswasion &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable assurance thereof in this present life.
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.20 2. Pet. 1.10</note>
            </p>
            <p>The way to bring vs to the end of our iourney (being the second thing which a traueller is to looke vnto) consisteth in two things, whereof the one is the first and more principall in nature and order, the other being the second, is like to the first and springing from it. The first is to belieue truely in the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ that hee</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.28. &amp;. 3.16.36.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:456:4"/>
               <hi>is our Lord and our God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.12. &amp;. 16.23.</note> &amp; that by him alone wee haue full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of al our sinnes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicity both of soule and body.</p>
            <p>The second being as it were the fruit and branch springing from thence (without which wee vtterly deceiue our selues in it, embracing a shadow in stead of the substance &amp; a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in stead of faith) is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vnfainedly of all our sins, beeing smitten with a godlie sorrow for them, and perfect hatred of them, firmely resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to forsake them finally, and daily to resist them,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.3.5. Ier. 3.10.</note>
               <hi>with full purpose of heart to cleaue to
<pb facs="tcp:456:5"/>the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.10. 2. Kin. 5.17 Act. 11.23. &amp; 24.16.</note>
               <hi>and neuer to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to folly, but to exercise our selues, to haue a cleere conscience, both towards God and towards men continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing (to come to the third point) that will most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually further vs in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall iourney, is a religious and constant vse of all holy meanes and helps, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and priuate,
<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5.22.</note> which God in his wisedome and mercy hath ordained and sanctified to that end and purpose;
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.7 8.13.14.15.16.</note> and chiefly of the word and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby those corruptions are kept vnder, that would bring vs to perdition,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15</note> &amp; those
<pb facs="tcp:456:5"/>heauenly graces kindled and quickned in vs, without which we can neuer come to eternall glory.</p>
            <p>The things that hinder vs in our spirituall iourney, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as causes or occasions. The causes are partly from without vs (though they come very neere vnto vs and get within vs) &amp; partly (yea prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally) from within vs. The causes from without vs (and yet getting within vs) are the <hi>sifting or winnowing of Satan</hi> &amp; his Angels (against whom we are continually to wrestle) <hi>who as roaring Lions walke about seeking whom they may deuoure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 22.3.31.</note>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.3 Eph. 6.12. 1. Pet. 5.8.</note>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:456:6"/>
            <p>The causes from within vs and which (in <hi>Adam</hi>) wee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willinglie pulled vpon our selues (being indeed the direct and proper causes of our ruine) are our owne corrupt affections,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1. &amp;c. Acts 5.3. Eccl. 7.31. Mat. 15.18.</note> or (as the holy Apostle calleth them) <hi>our owne pleasures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 4.1. &amp; 1.13.14.</note>
               <hi>or lusts, that fight and make war in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi> and whereby (as hee said before in the same Epistle) we are drawne away and entised.</p>
            <p>The occasions which doe incumber and hinder vs in our spirituall passage towards the kingdome of heauen, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of two sorts; whereof some are such as (according
<pb facs="tcp:456:6"/>to the common phrase of speech) may be said to come on the left hand; others are such, as (according to the like phrase) may bee said to come on the right hand.
<note place="margin">Pro. 30.9.</note> The first (as the wise man saith) cause vs to steale and robbe men of their goods, the other causeth men to deny (or bely) God, and rob him of his glorie.</p>
            <p>The occasions comming on our left hand are sicknesse,
<note place="margin">Deu. 28.34 Eccles. 7.9.</note> pouerty, oppression, reproach, deformitie, and the like, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and meanes whereof many are distracted, deiected,
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.24 &amp;. 6.9. &amp;. 15.22.23.24. &amp;. 16.2.3. &amp;. 17.8.9</note> discouraged and greatly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in their passage towards
<pb facs="tcp:456:7"/>the heauenly Ierusalem; as the Israelites (through their owne corruption) were hindered by the like occasion in their passage and trauel towards the earthly Canaan.</p>
            <p>The occasions on the right hand, as they are much more gratefull and pleasing to flesh &amp; bloud, then those are which come on the left hand, so are they much more powerfull to doe vs hurt.</p>
            <p>Of this sort are prosperitie, health, wit, wealth, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, beauty, and the like: of al which being abused (as for the most part, and by the greatest number they bee) it may bee
<pb facs="tcp:456:7"/>truely saide of them all which the Apostle saith of one of them (namely riches) that <hi>they bring men into tentation &amp; snares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.9</note>
               <hi>and into many foolish and noysome lusts, which drowne men in perdition and destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these occasionall hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances (as I may call them) the holy Apostle speaketh in the second Chapter of his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: saying,
<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2, 15.16.</note>
               <hi>Loue not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loue this world, the loue of the Father is not in him. For all that is in this world, as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye and the pride of life, is not of the Father but
<pb facs="tcp:456:8"/>of this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where (as with some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly men I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it) <hi>by the lust of the flesh,</hi> he meaneth carnall and fleshly affections, feeding vpon beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and other like baites of the sensuall and voluptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: fearefull examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the iudgements fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing there vpon, we haue in <hi>Shechem</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hamor:</hi>

            <p>The Emperor <hi>Caligula</hi> (a monster rather then a man) onely wished that al the heads of the people of Rome stood vpon one necke, to the end he might chop them all off at one blow, meaning by heads their

<pb facs="tcp:456:14"/>by this patheticall and earnest speech hee iustifieth his owne fasting and mourning, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others by his example to doe the like: shewing therein, that the chiefe reason, why men are not moued with such iudgements as they should, is because they doe not <hi>know,</hi> that is, duly consider and lay to heart the greatnesse of their losse.</p>
            <p>If King <hi>Dauid</hi> laid the death of <hi>Abner,</hi> being no sonne, nor heire to the crown, but a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect onely (and a late recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled enemy) so neere his hart; Oh how ought we to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this vntimely death
<pb facs="tcp:456:15"/>(I speake according to man) of the eldest sonne of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soueraigne) being now come to mans estate, &amp; to that maturity &amp; ripenes of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisedome and valour, that many hundreds were refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder his shadow, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands, or rather milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, might haue tasted of the sweete fruit of his kingly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and magnanimitie in time to come.</p>
            <p>But alas wee may now, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, take vp the complaint of the holy Prophet and say of a number, not onely of our watchmen,

            </p>
            <p>In the meane time (as the same prophet saith in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next Chapter) <hi>The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart: and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
<pb facs="tcp:456:16"/>men are taken a way, and no man considereth, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is taken a way before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that great euill.</hi> Yea no man remēbreth (as he ought) the words of our Sauiour Christ, saying, <hi>The dayes will come</hi> (the Lord knoweth how so one and suddenly) <hi>when men shall say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 23.29 30 31.</note>
               <hi>blessed are the barren, and the wombs that neuer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue sucke.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He saying of <hi>Salomon</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered else where, may be fitly applied to these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and holy sentences set downe in this excellent booke of the Prouerbs:
<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.12</note>
               <hi>The words of the wise</hi> (saith he) <hi>are like goades and nailes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stned by the masters of the Assemblies which are guided by one Pastor:</hi> That
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:456:24"/>is to say,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.21</note>
               <hi>the Prophets and holy men of God, who spake</hi> (not out of their owne braine) <hi>but as they were moued by the holy Ghost,</hi> haue a double vse. The first is, by precepts, admonitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, threatnings and promises (as it were by certaine pricks and goads) to stirre vp the dulnesse and deadnesse of our blockish and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie natures to a cherefull and fruitfull performance of all holy dueties of pietie and iustice. The second vse is (by the same helps and meanes) to bridle and restraine vs from euill, and (as it were by certaine nailes and pinnes, by which sheepeheards vsed to fasten their sheepefolde to the ground) to retaine and keep vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bosome of the Church, and within the bounds of faith, and holy obedience to the commandements of God. And the rather (which is the chiefest commendation of all the rest) because they are the words of eternall life,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.68</note> euen the words of Iesus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:456:24"/>Christ the great and principal Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of our soules:
<note place="margin">Col. 3.16. 2. Pet. 5.4. Eph. 4.11. 2. Tim. 2.15.</note> freely giuen by him to his Church, together with officers and Ministers fit to deuide them aright.</p>
            <p>This saying may be fitly applied to these most soueraigne and holy sentences, which for the most part (by the opposition of one member to the other) containe in them, both a bridle to euill,
<note place="margin">Whence the word Prouerbe hath his beginning</note> and a spurre to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I call them soueraigne or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sentences, in respect of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew roote (or verbe) from whence this word Prouerbe doth spring, which signifieth to rule, raigne, and beare dominion. The Patriarches disdained, and chafed, when they heard,
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.8.</note> that their younger brother should be their Lord. <hi>Shalt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede</hi> (say they, vsing the very same word in the originall which is here vsed) <hi>raigne ouer vs? Or shalt thou haue dominion ouer vs? And they hated him yet the more for his dreames and for his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:456:25"/>words.</hi> But let vs not disdaine, but rather desire and pray that these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs may dwell and raigne in our hearts and gouerne our liues; and not our owne lusts and carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. When the people of Israell would haue made <hi>Gedeon</hi> their king, hee refused,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 8.23.</note> saying; <hi>I will not raigne ouer you, neither shall my child raigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you, but the Lord shall raigne ouer you:</hi> Euen so when Satan or any of his instruments would perswade vs (as <hi>Ionadab</hi> did <hi>Amnon</hi>) to giue way to our owne lusts:
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.4.5.</note> let vs answere with valiant and victorious <hi>Gedeon,</hi> you shall not rule me, nor leade mee captiue, but the Lord shall rule ouer me;
<note place="margin">Psal. 85.8. 2. King. 22.14.</note> alwaies resoluing with the holy Prophet <hi>to hearken what the Lord saith,</hi> and with zealous and faithfull <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>speake nothing, but what the Lord shall put into our mouth,</hi> nor to doe any thing, but what hee shall require at our hands. Now to haue the Lord rule ouer vs, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:456:25"/>haue his word (whereof these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs are an excellent part) rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, is all one. For God doth rule vs by his word, and by his spirit: and the Prophet praying that God would <hi>feed</hi> (that is,
<note place="margin">Micah 7.14.</note> instruct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne) <hi>his people with his rodde,</hi> doth teach the same.</p>
            <p>These holy Prouerbs then (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from whence we digressed) by the opposition of the one member to the other, doe (for the most part) containe both a bridle to euill, and a spur to goodnes; and may fitly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to some one commandement of the law, or to some one article of the faith: or at least either to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law or Gospell in generall.
<note place="margin">To what comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular scope and drift of it.</note> Touching the prouerb cōtained in this ver. though it cānot so directly bee referred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one precept, as many of the rest may: yet it may serue as a bridle to restraine pride; that is, the ouer prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and (as it were) the idolizing of our selues, forbidden in the first and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:456:26"/>second commandements. Likewise it serueth to restraine, the abuse of such outward blessings, &amp; common gifts, as God bestoweth vpon men; by which abuse of the creature, the name of the Creator is taken in vain, contrarie to the third commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It may serue moreouer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine, the great prophanation of the Lords day, which very many (as we shall heare anon) doe very vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly mispend, by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such outward ornaments as God of his bountie bestoweth vpon them.</p>
            <p>The like might be said touching the commandements of the second table. For this prouerbe may serue as a bridle to restraine the insolencie of them, who by occasion of these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things are puffed vp in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and doe honour many whom they should despise, and despise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whom they ought to honour, flat contrary to the fifth cōmandement.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:456:26"/>By the same reason it may serue to restraine murther (<hi>for onely by pride doth man make contention,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 13.10.</note> picke quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, make fraies, kil and shead blood) which is forbidden in the sixth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: and adulterie (which many are drawn into by a faire face) forbidden in the seuenth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: And theft (which a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber commit to set forth as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and adorne this golden iewel) forbidden in the eight commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and lying (for pride makes men giue more to themselues, and some others,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 8.28.29.</note> and againe to detract and take away from some more then is due) forbidden in the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Finally concupiscence (forbidden in the tenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which is set on fire when beautie is had in more admiration then piety and vertue, is here restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and contrariwise it may serue very notablie, as a spurre, to pietie, humilitie, meeknesse, modestie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:456:27"/>iustice, truth, and many other holie duties required in the first and second table of the Law. Generally it doth admonish all such as haue good naturall parts (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) that is to say, wit, memory, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, strength, beautie, and the like; or do abound with outward things, as riches, honor, successe and other of that kind: Or of industry, as arte, learning, experience, and such things as are gotten by studie, labour, and trauell.</p>
            <p>This Prouerbe (I say) doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all such, to labour so much the rather for an answerable measure of spirituall grace, without which these common gifts and endowments, do no way grace and adorne them; but rather disgrace and deforme them, and make them more loathsome, and vglie in the eies of God, and of all those whom hee hath enlightened and sanctified with soundnesse of iudgement, and vprightnesse of hart.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:456:27"/>
            <p>The argument (and as it were the naile and bridle) whereby all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons are restrained from taking pride in outward things,
<note place="margin">The logical Analysis and order obserued, in handling of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe.</note> and likewise the spur and goade where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are quickened, and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward to labour, and studie constantly, that their inward, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces may bee answerable to those common gifts and outward good things which God hath besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon them; is drawne from a similitude or comparison, which may bee thus laid forth: If all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, common and bodily gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prophane and vngodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no better then a iewel of gold becommeth a swine, vpon whose snout it is hung; then let no such persons please themselues, or take pride in their wit, health, strength, riches, beautie, birth, or the like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bodily, and worldly blessings; but rather, labour, and studie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to decke, enrich and beautifie
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:456:28"/>the inward and hidden man of the heart, and to make their spirituall and heauenly graces, answerable and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their outward and naturall gifts and endowments. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and plainely set it downe in this Prouerbe) that none of these things become a prophane person, any beter then a iewell of gold becommeth a swine vpon whose snout it is hung. Therefore let no meere naturall man, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane &amp; carnall person, take pride in any such thing, but rather bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and feare, and labour daily to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and beautifie their soules, and enrich themselues with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable measure of spirituall and heauenly graces, by an holy vse of all good meanes (as hearing, reading, praying, conferring and the like) which God hath appointed for that purpose.</p>
            <p>But what? (may some say) is it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:456:28"/>lawfull for them that be regenerate, and spirituall persons, and are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the gift,
<note place="margin">The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe, nor can place their delight in such things.</note> and grace of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take pride in such things? I answere that it is not lawfull for any to take pride in these things, because it is not lawfull for any to sinne: As touching those that be spirituall, and truely regenerate, as it is not lawfull, so it is not possible; for if their chiefe glory and delight bee in such things, they are not spirituall but carnall. I grant that being (for a time) left to themselues, or giuen ouer to Satan (as holy <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Chron. 21.1.2 &amp;c. 2. Chron. 32.31. Psal. 1.2.</note> and godly <hi>Hezekias</hi> were) they may be tickled with vain glory, and puffed vp with pride by reason of these things: Otherwise their maine delight is in the law of the Lord,
<note place="margin">&amp; 4.6. Luk. 10.20. &amp; 2. Pet. 1.10.</note> and in the euidence of his loue, and assurance of their election to eternall life. Wherefore though Gods children ought to be thankfull for such things, and take comfort in them, as pledges and testimonies of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:456:29"/>the loue of their heauenly Father: yea and are sometime drawne away (by the law of their members,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against the law of their minds) to glory and ioy in these things more then is meet: yet euen when they sleepe,
<note place="margin">Cant 5.2. Mat. 6.21. Rom. 7.22</note> their hearts are awake, their minds are in heauen, where their treasure is, and they delight in the law of God concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man.</p>
            <p>But (to come to the points to bee noted) let vs first consider y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> meaning of the words themselues,
<note place="margin">The parts of this text.</note> with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of some such questions, and doubts, as may arise from them. And secondly let vs obserue and note some of the profits, and vses as may bee gathered from this prouerbe so cleared and expounded:
<note place="margin">The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of som doubts arising from them.</note>
               <hi>As a Iewell of gold in a swines snout,</hi> that is to say, as any outward ornament of gold, pearle, pretious stone, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther costly, rich and curious thing, bestowed vpon a swine, or hung vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:456:29"/>the snout of a hogge is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, ridiculous, and vnseemely, and doth no way become him, or hinder him from wallowing in the mire (for hee will wallow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the lesse, yea perhaps the more to rub it of) but is rather spoiled, lost, and quite cast away vpon him: Euen so are beautie, wit, strength, birth, portion, good education, and the like, bestowed vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men (in true iudgement) absurd, ridiculous, and vnseemely, and doe no way become them, or hinder thē from tumbling in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and voluptuousnesse, and wallowing in the mire, &amp; puddle of their sins. (for they will wallow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the lesse, yea much the more as shall be shewed anon by occasion of these things) but are rather quite spoyled, vtterly lost, and cleane cast away vpon them. <hi>A woman that lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth discretion.</hi>] That is, refractary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse and opposite, to the sound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,

For as hee that is sicke of a feuer, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth lately from some great feast, cannot taste his drinke though it bee neuer so good, nor rellish his meate, though it be neuer so daintie. (for as it is said in another Prouerbe:

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Question why beauty is put for all outward blessings.</hi> Gen. 12.15.</note> and learned Phisition.</p>
            <p>Here if any shall say, why is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (being one of the least) put for all other outward blessings? I answere; first, because it is generally more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, marked, and spoken of by the greatest part of men and women in the world (at least in their yong, and youthfull daies) then any other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornament. Secondly, it is not a thing concealed, as strength, which is not knowne till it bee tried, or as learning, which lieth hid in the brest till it bee shewed; or as riches, which lieth hid in the chest till it come to light; but is obuious, and open,
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.7.</note> to the view and eyes of all, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all (especially the vnchast, and vndiscreet) to gaze at it, and talke of it, and them that haue it to take the more pride and delight in it.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Question why this prouerbe is vsed of the woman.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if it bee demanded, why this prouerbe is vsed of the woman rather then of the man, seeing pride
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:456:31"/>is as deepely rooted in the man as in the woman, and seeing the holy Ghost (for the most part) both in this book, and throughout the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doth put the man for both sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, woman and man? I answere, first, because (in common account) beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and fairenesse of face is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, marked, and talked of, being bestowed vpon a woman, then when it is bestowed vpon a man, who is rather admired for his strength, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.42.</note> and courage, then for his beautie, and faire complexion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because although both sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (by reason of that corruption which is common to them both) be louers of themselues, and of these outward gifts, more then of God the fountaine and giuer of them; yet of the two (as both Scripture and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teach) the woman is more fraile and weake that way,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.7.</note> and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take pride in her beautie and fairenesse then the man; whose cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:456:31"/>and commendation (as hath bin said) standeth rather in the strength of his bodie,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 8.20.21.</note> and courage of his minde, then in the beautie and faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his face.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded,
<note place="margin">3. Question. whether beautie be in it selfe a blessing or no?</note> whether beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it selfe be not a blessing, and to be reckoned among the benefits and gifts which God bestoweth vpon men? I answere, yes, it is an outward &amp; bodily blessing, as health, strength, riches, and other things of that kind are, though farre inferiour to them, being neither so necessarie for the comfort of mans life, nor so auailable to the performance of the duties of Christianitie, and of our seuerall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: yet a blessing and an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God bestoweth, both vpon men and women, for good and holy purposes. The diuine beautie of <hi>Moses,</hi> was a speciall motiue,
<note place="margin">Exod. 2.2. Act. 7.20.</note> to cause his mother so carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale, and hide him as long as shee could (euen three moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:456:32"/>and afterwards to moue <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutis</hi> (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> calleth her) <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> daughter, the rather to pity him and prouide for him, and (by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruling of Gods most wise and gratious prouidence) to put him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the bosome of his owne mother to giue him sucke. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (among women) the beauty of <hi>Ester</hi> was a speciall meanes to prefer her to be wife to <hi>Assuerus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ester 2.7.8. &amp;c.</note> that great and mighty Monarch of Persia, and consequently a gratious instrument of that great deliuerance and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the whole Church, from the bloody designes of wicked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> together with the ruine of him, and his whole familie, and of all that cursed nation, who were prepared to make a massacre of the people of God.
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.6.7.20. Psal. 105.18. 2. Sam. 13.1.2.3.4. &amp;c</note> And though <hi>Iosephs</hi> faire face were an occasion of his commitment to that foule prison, in which (as it is said) the iron entred into his soule; and <hi>Tamars</hi> beautie were an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:456:32"/>first of filthie incest, and after of cruell bloodshed and murther: yet that is no dispraise to this ornament of beautie, which God in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of his bountie bestowed vpon them. For although the best outward gifts, and blessings of God bee by the sonnes and daughters of Belial abused (as the high and holy priesthod was by <hi>Elyes</hi> sonnes) yet they are notwithstanding to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good in their owne nature,
<note place="margin">1.

For by the former, that is, by the beautie of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> which was accidentally an occasion of his commitment, and consequently of his preferment (for if he had not bin prisoner in that place, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> butler could not haue had knowledge of his gift, and commended him to the King.) God made way for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:456:33"/>of his mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; in preseruing of <hi>Iacobs</hi> family, and posterity, that is to say, of the the whole, and onely visible Church of God, at that time remaining in the world; and by the other, (that is by the beautie of <hi>Tamar,</hi> which was the occasion of <hi>Ammons</hi> incest, and after of his being murthered by his brother <hi>Absolon</hi>) God made way for the manifestation of his truth, and iustice, in that he punished the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, and murther committed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> as he had threatned by the Prophet <hi>Nathan;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.11.12. &amp;c.</note> If any say that by the same reason sinne it selfe, may be counted a blessing of God, seeing he turneth it to the good of his chosen:

<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.19. Iohn. 8.41.44.</note> that sinne is a fruit of the flesh and worke of the diuell; but beautie is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and workmanship of God:
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.11 1. Ioh. 3.4. Numb. 22.30.</note> sin is a spirituall defection, and swaruing from his law; which hee willingly permitteth (as he did in <hi>Balaam</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (such is the infinitenesse of his wisedome, power,

Out of which words
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:456:35"/>we may obserue foure profits &amp; vses of the holy Scripture, that is to say, doctrine, confutation, correction and instruction: wherof the two former serue to enlighten the mind, &amp; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, &amp; rectifie the iudgement and vnderstanding in the sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; and the two latter to reforme, direct and quicken the will and affections to the true faith, feare, loue, &amp; holy obedience of the same. For there are vsually in all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies foure sorts of hearers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are ignorant not knowing the truth, and had need to be taught with words of wholesome doctrine:
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.7.</note> others are enwrapped, and entangled in some errour, these must be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conuinced by the word of truth. Againe, some though they know the truth in a good measure, and be not entangled with any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour contrarie to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine they haue receiued; yet they are led captiue, and giue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:456:36"/>themselues ouer to the seruice of some sinne, one or other, (yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more then one) these must be corrected and reproued: Others though they both know the truth, and bee free from any dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, neither bee inthralled to any scandalous vice, or raigning sin; yet they are dull, and defectiue, heauie and forgetfull, weake hearted, and slowhanded, in the performing of good and holy duties; these must be instructed, exhorted, admonished, encouraged and comforted, to the further strengthening of their faith, and quickening of their obedience. And in very deed, there is no congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation vpon earth, but there are som (more or lesse) of all these sorts: Nay (which is more) there is not any one man in the world so learned, but hee may be,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.9</note> yea, and is ignorant of some thing; nor so sound, and orthodox but hee may erre in some points of diuinitie; nor so holy but hee is tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And first of all let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the wise man teacheth vs in that excellent book of his which is called the Preacher; that is to say, that all things in the world are vain where the feare of God is wanting, which is in effect the summe, and substance of that heauenly treatise: namely, that learning, pleasure, riches,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 1.1.2.3. &amp;c.</note> honour and the like, without the true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faigned feare of God, are nothing els but most vaine vanity and vexation of mind, as may appeare by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the former part of the booke comprehended in the eleuen first

            <p>For hauing shewed the vanitie, and vexation that is in studie and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in pleasures and delights, in riches and preferment, in youth and old age, he maketh his conclusion by way of preuention, or meeting with that which might bee obiected to him, or demanded of him, which in effect is thus much: If this be so that all these things (that is to say, studie, learning, pleasure, riches, honour, youth and age) be full of vanitie, and vexation of spirit, what shall men do? what course shal they take? or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shall they looke to finde any true comfort and contentment of mind?

In answering of whom I wil not wade into the discussing of that question (which the opposition of some diuines hath made difficult and doubtfull) touching the originall of the soule, whether it come mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the parents by the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or immediately from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

<note place="margin">Psal. 51.5.</note> yet it is at least (which none will deny) capable of it, and doth (as they terme it) potentially or in power and possibility carry it alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Whereupon it followeth that the reason which the Lord vseth to aggrauate the hainousnesse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter (namely <hi>Because he made man in the image of God</hi>) will lie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily against such vnnaturall and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proud mothers,

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:456:102"/>in his face, or mending any fault in his apparell; for daily experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the contrary: but his drift and meaning is to shew, that carelesse and vnconscionable christians (of which sort the most part are) reape no more fruit by the holy word of God, for the edifying of their consciences, &amp; amendment of their liues, then they do for the clensing of their skin or mending their cloathes, who look in a glasse after a sleight and supersiciall manner.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:456:106"/>Besides, <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe doth professe before them all, that he did not know (or at least acknowledge) him to bee a lawfull high priest; for if hee had, he would not haue vsed those words, nor called him whited wall, because the Scripture saith, <hi>Thou shalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile the ruler of thy people.</hi> And we read how submissely, and modestly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe afterwards towards <hi>Festus</hi> (an idolatrous &amp; heathē man) being a magistrate.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing the last sommer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one, solitarie in the Country, I was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed by the weekelie letters of one <hi>M. Iohn Withyman,</hi> a learned and godly yong man, who (if pouerty had not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to spend that time in attending vpon the presse, which hee should and most gladly would haue bestowed vpon his study) might haue proued (in mine opinion) if God had prolonged his daies and blessed his labors, a man in all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (especially diuine, whereunto hee was deuoted, being a minister and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the word) inferiour to few that I know in this age. This good yong man, being my kind neighbour, and hauing beene sometime my seruant and scholler
<pb facs="tcp:456:118"/>in the Citie; and after (by my meanes) placed in the vniuersitie, (where for the time his profiting was not ordinary) did in one or two of his letters request mee, that if I had any thing lying by me, that I thought might be of vse for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a benefit to him, I would send it to him, because now he had good leisure to perfect and publish it, faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that he would vse such liberty in adding and detracting, &amp; altring both the phrase and matter, as that it might bee trulie counted his owne. Vpon this condition I sent him this little <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> which here you see, not doubting, but that (according to his promise) hee would haue put a better coate and shape vpon it; but beeing preuented by the stroake of God, which at that time was to him so vnexpected (but for which he was at no time vnprepared) it returned (after some space of time) to mee againe as it went from mee, whereupon I ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into some doubtfull deliberation what to doe with it, inclining rather to
<pb facs="tcp:456:118"/>bury it in silence, then to suffer it to see the light, in this censorious and learned age, yet in fine (being incouraged by some friends) I gaue way to the publishing of it; trusting by the mercy of God, that it may be profitable to some, and hoping that it wil neither be offensiue nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to any; for which I pray, and desire thee therein to ioyne with me. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing plainly and truely shewed thee the occasion of this bolde aduenture.
